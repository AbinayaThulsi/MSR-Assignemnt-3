# Soft Alignment Model for Bug Duplication

This is a further research project on paper - "A Soft Alignment Model for Bug Deduplication". The paper aims at the state-of-art development of a novel soft alignment method which helps to identify the distinct bug reports for the same bug registered by multiple users. A novel deep learning model named SABD is implemented to achieve this. Further, the results are evaluated based on the rank-based metric.

## Threat

The model is slower than the methods based on Siamese neural networks. Hence the runtime itself is high with GPU. In our case, as mentioned by us in assignment 2 we ran using CPU so the time taken will be even more. Hence, we decided to work on reducing the runtime using other algorithms.

## Theory

If this has to be used in real-time and GPU is not available then it will be difficult to find the bugs as the time taken will be more. We are planning to address this issue by using different algorithm in Siamese network which is YOCO(You Only Compare Once). YOCO compares many records in one forward propogation. Using this we can reduce the run time. We have got some idea about few alternate algorithms that can be used. We will try to overcome this issue by trying the different algorithms.

## Experiment

As mentioned during the agreement the only threat that we came accross was runtime issue. Since the fixed-length representations of the reports is being generated jointly, it seemed to be hard to save computation time. Hence, the SABD model is slower based on Siamese neural networks. In-Order to reduce the runtime, we looked for many alternative sources. 
### First Approach :
One such alternative which we came across was implementing an algorithm called [YOLO](https://medium.com/@kuzuryu71/improving-siamese-network-performance-f7c2371bdc1e). The idea behind the choice of YOLO was, it compares many bugs in one forward propagation steps. This helps in reducing the execution time faster. 
We started looking into YOCO (You Only Compare Once) and YOLO(You Only Look Once). These are the techniques used to improve the performance in siamese network. YOLO is the algorithm which detects or finds duplicates in one forward propogation instead of going in loop and YOCO compares in one forward propogation. We went through many papers and GitHub repositories to address our threat in the similar way.  Since there were not many resources available, we ourself tried to implement the idea of algorithm. But, we were not able to fix the issue.

### Second Approach:
Secondly, we decided to proceed with of changing Siamese algorithm, using YOCO and YOLO in this algorithm. We started working on siamese_pairs code and we made some code changes. Please refer [assignment 2](https://github.com/AbinayaThulsi/MSR-Soft-Alignment-Model-for-Bug-Duplication) for the data extraction part.

##### Command to Execute :
```bash
python3 experiments/siamese_pairs.py  -F HOME_DIR/experiments with HOME_DIR/duplicate-bug-report/json_parameters/siamese_pair_test_eclipse.json "recall_rate.window=365"
```
But it was able to run only until the 1st epoch, afterwards we started getting segmentation error. Later, We thought of implementing YOCO and YOLO concept in siamese pair code but we couldnt find more resource for YOCO and YOLO and how it can be used in textual module , The resource we found was for image module and we could have used the concept and implemented in siamese code we have updated but as we started searching deeply about both the algorithms we understood that sabd is already better than [Siamese](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1467314)(SABD might be slower than siamese but when real time is considered sabd outperforms siamese pair and siamese triplet). So if we succeed in saving runtime then performance in terms of recall rate would still be less and we did not want to spend much time in fixing the code. Instead of investing more time on this we started looking into other techniques.

### Third Approach:
As the [attention mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) computes interdependent representations for each report jointly for pair of possibly duplicate reports, it is the main reason for the model being slow and not being efficiently faster. So, we even tried to split and generate the representation in batches. But the bug duplicate report detection accuracy was not remarkable. As already stated in the paper, even though fixed representation consumes more time the model performs the best only by that. 

# Conclusion
Along with above mentioned three approaches, we further investigated several related works and papers. We also understood that SABD is using best and realistic methodology compared to other models addressed in other similar papers, which was mentioned in our paper as well. Nevertheless, we still wanted to try out few other alternatives and come to conclusion and concluded that, the mentioned three approaches seemed more suitable for addressing the Bug tracking Systemâ€™s (BTS) threat. It cannot be said that reducing the execution time is impossible because the Siamese approach seems to be quiet convincing.  But, with the time constraints and few available resources it was hard to try other approaches completely. While trying out the methodologies, we were facing challenges in either resolving the issues or method was more time consuming compared to SABD approach.

Here are few links that are stated in paper. Ongoing through these reference, it is explainable why our paper is already considered as best compared to other existing models. 
1.	[Siamese](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8094414) As mentioned above all Siamese related papers can be considered to overcome few issues but the existing one's will give lower RR@K compared to SABD.
2.	Few techniques used by [Poddar et al](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-2020/) in this paper is taken to implement SABD.
3.	[Sun et al](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6100061) mean average precision (MAP) and recall rate@k (RR@k) techniques used in this paper is taken to implement SABD.

The below are the references we came across during our research. These papers were facing similar threats as ours which makes use of other techniques. 
4.	[Automated Duplicate Detection for Bug Tracking Systems](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/p/weimer-dsn2008.pdf) is a very old paper which uses linear regression, but many new techniques are come into light now a days for the amount of data we are getting in real world.
5.	[Budhiraja](https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3183440)'s technique is already referred by our author. So, we either found very old techniques or the ones used in our paper as reference to make our paper the best.

Even though the previous works similar to SABD they were are not much helpful, this research helped to realise that SABD model of Bug tracking system is the combination of all best techniques which were addressed separately in previous works. Hence, having execution time constraint to be the only threat we could not find much resource which can be used to make our code even better. We tried all the possible techniques we can come up with.
