\n\njapheth and lisa    would it be appropriate to release note this behavior \nthe only way i can see to  fix  this bug is to explain to the user how\nit really works  because the behavior is as expected \ni initially thought\nthis could be best accomplished by adding some text to the s mime\ncipher selection dialog window  but changing the ui now by adding a new\nstring is  as i think you know  a monumental task \nso  i think our\nonly ptions are  try to add a couple of sentences to the dialog window\n convincing mtoy and mindy that this is really necessary   or add\nsomething to the release notes  or do nothing at all for dogbert \ni d appreciate your input in this    and  if you want the first option \ni ll need your help in convincing mtoy and mindy that this change is\nimportant \nthanks \n        additional comments from lchiang  05 07 97 13 41         \n\nthis explanation could be added to the on line help rather than release notes \nit appears that the

comments from jsw  05 07 97 18 11         \n\nlisa  if you have the words you want to use  you should probably add\nthem to the bug so that they don t get lost \nyou can talk to mike melton melton

i never really noticed it before because\ni never look at the title bar in my mail or news windows \ni m really\nsurprised that it happens on win and unix but not on mac  i would have\nthought it d be all the same backend problem \nanyway  i d like the\nmail news group to own this problem but it seems like that is unlikely \nso i thought i d see if i d be able to fix it myself  perhaps with

tfv 4 5 \nwas this one overlooked \ni just looked at 4 5 mac  and the only reason it appears that the mac is not \naffected is because it doesn t use the subject line info in its title bar  as \nwin and unix do \ni suggest either making this platform  all  again  since the \n4 02 reasoning is now moot   or opening a separate and additional bug on \nwindows \n        additional comments from scurtis  05 26 98 13 55         \n\nsomething interesting about this bug  \n\nif you send yourself a signed message with a web page attached  not just the url\nincluded in an html message   the messenger title bar will display the title of\nthe attached web page \nalso  going back to 4 04  when you click on a regular signed message  you can\nsee the title bar flash what looks like an imap url really fast before it fails\nto display the message subject \nchanging severity from major to normal  since this is just an\noptionally implemented display issue \n        additional comments from repka  05 26 98 14 55         \n\nchanging the platform back to all  as stacey suggested \nthe problem\nis in the backend  libmime     it exists  at least in some sense  on\nall platforms \n it might even be that if you viewed an s mime message\nin a browser window    does that have a real title bar  filled in\nby the  title  tag  on the mac \n   you would then see it on the mac\nas well  \nas for what tfv this bug should have  that confusion lies in the\nownership of this bug \nit s one of those limbo bugs  falling\nsomewhere between security and mail news \nit s really not clear\nwhich of us  should  own it \ni d been thinking that if i could\nfigure out how to fix it  i d go ahead and do that \ni would \nin fact  prefer to fix it in 4 1  but i m not sure i ll figure\nit out in time to do that \nbtw  i know  why  it s happening  but i don t know what the\nfix should be \nit happens because the display of each s mime\nmessage involves a table created for the headers  in order to\nput the  signed   etc \nicons over on the right of the headers  \nbut when the  title  tag is then output for the subject line \nour layout code ignores it because it doesn t allow a  title \nto be specified from within a table definition \n and when\nlibmime parses subsequent stuff  like an attachment  if it\nputs out a  title  later  that one will  take   which is why\nyou see an attachment s subject in the title  \ni think the\nfix  then  is to somehow put the  title  out either before\nor after the table of headers and icon are put out \nprobably\nafter is the only way that will really work \nbut i m not sure\nthat s the right solution  and even so i don t know where to\ndo it  and how to find the subject text  \nthat s where i am at\nthe moment  i m only working on this bug occasionally  in the\nbackground \n if someone from the mail news group would be willing to take\nthis bug and fix it in 4 5  i d be quite happy to let go of it \n   \n\n        additional comments

has been marked as a duplicate of this bug \n   \n\n        additional comments from repka  07 28 98 15 59         \n\n fyi  you may want to look at the text in bug 301971 for another\nview on the problem \nbut i have tried to include all of the\nnecessary information here  \nhere is what i think is the minimum needed to reproduce this bug \n   have html mail compose turned on \n  view a message with an s mime  attachment  \n this can be\n   one you already happen to have or one you create \nit can be\n   signed or encrypted or both  though just signed is probably\n   the easiest to deal with and to pass around to others \nit doesn t matter as long as it is an attachment with a nice\n   s mime icon showing in its header \nbut bug verifiers may want\n   to be thorough and try all combinations  \n  do a quoted reply to that message \nthe problem is that the quoted html includes the s mime icon link \nbut it shouldn t \nnote that if you take the same message and do a\nquoted forward on it  the quoted html does not include the s mime\nicon link \ni think that if the quoted forward is able to avoid\nincluding the s mime icon link  there is probably  hopefully  \na way to make the quoted reply do it similarly  too \nalso note that if you are replying using plain text  not html  you\nget a textual representation of the s mime icon link \nthat shouldn t\nbe there either  but i think it will fall out in the wash when the\nhtml problem is fixed  because that textual representation also does\nnot show up in the quoted forward \ni m not sure if this problem is in libmime  or in the invocation\nof it  but given the quoted forward behavior  i m presuming the latter \njamie may be able to shed a little light on that  if he is so inclined \nin any case  i don t think this is my bug at all  so i m starting with\njefft as my best guess \njeff  please reassign as appropriate \n        additional comments from jefft  07 30 98 13 59         \n\nlooks like this has been fixed in nova \nforward qutoed   reply quoted do not \ninclude attachment s s mime icon \nhowever  forward as attachment does include \nthe s mime icon \n        additional comments from repka  07 30 98 14 07         \n\n  however  forward as attachment does include the s mime icon \nforwarding the message itself  as opposed to quoting it  doesn t\ninclude the icon but rather the entire message  which then gets\ndecoded and interpreted by the recipient  who does their own\nsignature verification \nit is very different  and fine  behavior \nthe  apparently now fixed  problem was that when quoting  only the\ntext gets taken  and the signature  for example  gets thrown away \nbut that icon tossed in there was inappropriate \nanyway  glad to hear the bug is gone \n        additional comments from repka  07 30 98 14 18         \n\nsorry  one more question \n\n  looks like this has been fixed in nova \nthis bug was reported against nova very recently  bug 301971  which\ni closed as a dup of this one  \nbob lord was able to reproduce it\nwith a fairly current nova \ndo you know how why the bug went away \ni think the change must have been made within the last week or two \ngiven that lord saw it on 7 24  not sure what build he was running  \ni d like to understand how this stuff works  why it behaved the way\nit did  etc   if it doesn t take too much of your time \n        additional comments from lord  07 30 98 16 53         \n\ni just downloaded today s version of nova  and it is not fixed \nit s trival to \nreproduce based on the script davidi provided \nthere may have been other fixes recently  but this one is still broken \n        additional comments from jefft  07 30 98 18 15         \n\nif forward quoted or forward inline then reply the problem does  not  exist \nif \nforward as attachment then reply the problem does exist \nreply quote \nforward as attachment message in html picks up the s mime icon \nsee the \nfollowing html content from the mail compose window \nlooks like we need to find \na way to strip out the s mime icon while quoting \n similar thing to do when \nreply quote into plain text  \ni should have tried forward as attachment
