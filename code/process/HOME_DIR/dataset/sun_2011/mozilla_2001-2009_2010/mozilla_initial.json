In the Configure Ciphers dialog in \nthe Messenger frame of the Security Advisor, he checks only DES EDE3 168-bit key \nand RC2 128 bit key for encryption.\n\nUser B uses the en-export.zip as policy.jar file (default).\n\n1. User A sends User B a signed message.\n2. User B reads User A's signed message, and send User A back an encrypted \nmessage.\n\nThe message is encrypted with DES 56-bit key, not the way User A specified. In \nfact User A sees the message is encrypted, and will falsely believe that the \nmessage is encrypted better than it actually is.\n\nUser B should not be able to send User A any encrypted message in this case. A \nwarning message should come up when User B tries to do it.\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  05\/02\/97 13:01 ------- \n\nAccording to what you described, the message should have ended up\nencrypted with RC2 and a 40-bit key, not with DES.  But I'll check\ninto that.  The behavior of encrypting the message with RC2\/40,\nhowever, is correct.  Accepting this bug for b5 in the chance that\nwe can find a better way to express this behavior in the UI.\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  05\/06\/97 10:51 ------- \n\nWhen I followed the steps, the message ended up encrypted with\nRC2 and a 40-bit key, which is the intended behavior.  I'm not\nsure why Japheth got DES; that behavior would be wrong -- when\nthe sender has no obvious algorithm and keysize to choose from,\nit should always \"fallback\" to RC2\/40.\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  05\/06\/97 10:54 ------- \n\n*** Bug 62318 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  05\/06\/97 11:13 ------- \n\nChanging the summary line and the priority\/severity; the algorithm\nchoosing code is behaving as it should, but the UI is broken and\nconfusing.\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  05\/07\/97 12:01 ------- \n\nJapheth and Lisa -- would it be appropriate to Release Note this behavior?\nThe only way I can see to \"fix\" this bug is to explain to the user how\nit really works, because the behavior is as expected.  I initially thought\nthis could be best accomplished by adding some text to the S\/MIME\nCipher Selection dialog window, but changing the UI now by adding a new\nstring is, as I think you know, a monumental task.  So, I think our\nonly ptions are: try to add a couple of sentences to the dialog window\n(convincing mtoy and mindy that this is really necessary), or add\nsomething to the Release Notes, or do nothing at all for Dogbert.\nI'd appreciate your input in this -- and, if you want the first option,\nI'll need your help in convincing mtoy and mindy that this change is\nimportant.  Thanks.\n\n------- Additional Comments From lchiang  05\/07\/97 13:41 ------- \n\nThis explanation could be added to the on-line help rather than release notes.  \nIt appears that the Security Advisor dialog has a Help push button.  What do you \nthink, Japheth?  I don't know what the deadlines for the Help contents are.\n\n\n------- Additional Comments From ko  05\/07\/97 15:55 ------- \n\nI prefer UI change, if it is possible. Otherwise I would propose no change, and \nmake sure we document the behavior in NetHelp. (We'll then make the change in \n4.01\/4.1 if there's one, or 5.0.) I don't think Release Notes is the place to \ndocument the behavior either.\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  05\/07\/97 17:58 ------- \n\nOkay, I tried to get the UI change in, but it was rejected by\nmtoy and mindy.  If you still feel strongly about it, I suggest\nyou try your own hand at convincing them.  They may still agree,\nbut I won't try any more.  (FWIW, the change itself is very easy;\nthe hardest part is choosing the right words to say it succinctly\nbut clearly.)\n\nSo, my plan is to LATER this bug, and I will try to put the words\nin the UI in whatever is the next appropriate release.  In the meantime,\nhow do we go about getting something into the on-line help?  I guess\nI shouldn't be so ignorant, but I actually have no idea...  \n\n------- Additional Comments From jsw  05\/07\/97 18:11 ------- \n\nLisa, if you have the words you want to use, you should probably add\nthem to the bug so that they don't get lost.\n\nYou can talk to Mike Melton(melton@netscape.com) about the help content.\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  05\/07\/97 18:40 ------- \n\nI had stashed away the words so I'd have them later, but no problem\nputting them here for safekeeping, too.  Now that I have a little time,\nI will continue to rewrite these words because I don't like them all\nthat much.  In any case, they would show up on the \"Select S\/MIME Ciphers\"\nHTML dialog, after the checkbox-list of ciphers.\n    \"The enabled ciphers are included in your signed messages as an\n     indication of your preference for the method of encryption used\n     for messages which are sent to you.  Disabling a particular\n     cipher does not guarantee a sender will not use it anyway.\"\n\nI also sent mail to Mike Melton.  Once I know this is going to get\nhandled in online-help, I will close this bug as LATER.\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  05\/09\/97 11:47 ------- \n\nMike Melton said he would try to get this into online-help, so I'm\nnow marking this as officially LATER.  We will try to make the cipher\npreferences dialog more explanatory in the next release.\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  07\/11\/97 10:08 ------- \n\nReopening this as a potential for being fixed in 4.02, if can get\napproval for the UI change.\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  07\/15\/97 10:25 ------- \n\nAdding a \"UI:\" to the front of the summary line, as per Mindy's request.\n\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  07\/15\/97 16:36 ------- \n\nI could tell that this fix was not going to be accepted for 4.02,\nso I'm just moving it to 5.0.\n\n------- Additional Comments From mindy  07\/15\/97 23:02 ------- \n\nthis ui change was rejected for all 4.x releases.  This should be fixed in 5.0. \n Thank you.\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  08\/08\/97 18:52 ------- \n\nPassing along to Mark Welch, new owner of S\/MIME.  It may actually make\nsense to fix this in 4.03, not in 5.0 -- that's up to Mark and others.\n(I don't know if 4.03 is going to be localized; if not, then fixing it\nin 4.03 should be no problem, and it would then get moved over into\n5.0 along with the rest of the 4.03 changes.)\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  05\/16\/98 14:44 ------- \n\nFixing cc list and assigning this back to me.  I can fix this bug\nwhenever someone will let me change some words in the UI.  That's\nall this bug needs.

The \"Set Default Encoding\" behavior is different across different windows.\n   For example, only the browser window remembers it from session to\n   to session.

I'm really\nsurprised that it happens on Win and Unix but not on Mac; I would have\nthought it'd be all the same backend problem.  Anyway, I'd like the\nmail\/news group to own this problem but it seems like that is unlikely.\nSo I thought I'd see if I'd be able to fix it myself, perhaps with a\npointer from you to get me started.\n\n------- Additional Comments From scurtis  05\/26\/98 12:56 ------- \n\nI just noticed this bug in 4.06 and 4.5. Didn't all 5.0 mail\/news bugs get \nmigrated to tfv 4.5? Was this one overlooked? \n\nI just looked at 4.5 Mac, and the only reason it appears that the Mac is not \naffected is because it doesn't use the subject line info in its title bar, as \nWin and Unix do. I suggest either making this platform=\"all\" again (since the \n4.02 reasoning is now moot), or opening a separate and additional bug on \nWindows. \n\n------- Additional Comments From scurtis  05\/26\/98 13:55 ------- \n\nSomething interesting about this bug: \n\nIf you send yourself a signed message with a web page attached (not just the URL\nincluded in an html message), the Messenger title bar will display the title of\nthe attached web page. \n\nAlso, going back to 4.04, when you click on a regular signed message, you can\nsee the title bar flash what looks like an IMAP URL really fast before it fails\nto display the message subject. \n\nChanging severity from major to normal, since this is just an\noptionally-implemented display issue. \n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  05\/26\/98 14:55 ------- \n\nChanging the platform back to All, as Stacey suggested.  The problem\nis in the backend (libmime) -- it exists, at least in some sense, on\nall platforms.  (It might even be that if you viewed an S\/MIME message\nin a browser window -- does that have a real title bar, filled in\nby the <TITLE> tag, on the Mac? -- you would then see it on the Mac\nas well.)\n\nAs for what tfv this bug should have, that confusion lies in the\nownership of this bug.  It's one of those limbo bugs, falling\nsomewhere between security and mail\/news.  It's really not clear\nwhich of us *should* own it.  I'd been thinking that if I could\nfigure out how to fix it, I'd go ahead and do that.  I would,\nin fact, prefer to fix it in 4.1, but I'm not sure I'll figure\nit out in time to do that.\n\nBTW, I know *why* it's happening, but I don't know what the\nfix should be.  It happens because the display of each S\/MIME\nmessage involves a table created for the headers (in order to\nput the \"Signed\", etc. icons over on the right of the headers).\nBut when the <TITLE> tag is then output for the Subject line,\nour layout code ignores it because it doesn't allow a <TITLE>\nto be specified from within a table definition.  (And when\nlibmime parses subsequent stuff, like an attachment, if it\nputs out a <TITLE> later, that one will \"take\", which is why\nyou see an attachment's Subject in the title.)  I think the\nfix, then, is to somehow put the <TITLE> out either before\nor after the table of headers-and-icon are put out.  Probably\nafter is the only way that will really work.  But I'm not sure\nthat's the right solution, and even so I don't know where to\ndo it (and how to find the subject text).  That's where I am at\nthe moment; I'm only working on this bug occasionally, in the\nbackground.\n\n(If someone from the mail\/news group would be willing to take\nthis bug and fix it in 4.5, I'd be quite happy to let go of it. ;-)\n\n------- Additional Comments From phil  05\/27\/98 11:53 ------- \n\nProbably the best owner for this bug is jefft, so I'll reassign to him.

(This can be\n   one you already happen to have or one you create.  It can be\n   signed or encrypted or both, though just signed is probably\n   the easiest to deal with and to pass around to others.\n   It doesn't matter as long as it is an attachment with a nice\n   S\/MIME icon showing in its header.  But bug verifiers may want\n   to be thorough and try all combinations.)\n - Do a quoted reply to that message.\n\nThe problem is that the quoted HTML includes the S\/MIME icon\/link,\nbut it shouldn't.  Note that if you take the same message and do a\nquoted forward on it, the quoted HTML does not include the S\/MIME\nicon\/link.  I think that if the quoted forward is able to avoid\nincluding the S\/MIME icon\/link, there is probably (hopefully?)\na way to make the quoted reply do it similarly, too.\n\nAlso note that if you are replying using plain text, not HTML, you\nget a textual representation of the S\/MIME icon\/link.  That shouldn't\nbe there either, but I think it will fall out in the wash when the\nHTML problem is fixed, because that textual representation also does\nnot show up in the quoted forward.  \n\nI'm not sure if this problem is in libmime, or in the invocation\nof it, but given the quoted forward behavior, I'm presuming the latter.\nJamie may be able to shed a little light on that, if he is so inclined.\nIn any case, I don't think this is my bug at all, so I'm starting with\njefft as my best guess.  Jeff, please reassign as appropriate.\n\n\n------- Additional Comments From jefft  07\/30\/98 13:59 ------- \n\nLooks like this has been fixed in Nova. Forward Qutoed & Reply Quoted do not \ninclude attachment's S\/MIME icon. However, Forward As Attachment does include \nthe S\/MIME icon.\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  07\/30\/98 14:07 ------- \n\n> However, Forward As Attachment does include the S\/MIME icon.\n\nForwarding the message itself (as opposed to quoting it) doesn't\ninclude the icon but rather the entire message, which then gets\ndecoded and interpreted by the recipient, who does their own\nsignature verification.  It is very different (and fine) behavior.\nThe (apparently now fixed) problem was that when quoting, only the\ntext gets taken (and the signature, for example, gets thrown away)\nbut that icon tossed in there was inappropriate.\n\nAnyway, glad to hear the bug is gone.\n\n\n\n------- Additional Comments From repka  07\/30\/98 14:18 ------- \n\nSorry, one more question:\n\n> Looks like this has been fixed in Nova.\n\nThis bug was reported against Nova very recently (bug 301971, which\nI closed as a dup of this one).  Bob Lord was able to reproduce it\nwith a fairly current Nova.  Do you know how\/why the bug went away?\nI think the change must have been made within the last week or two,\ngiven that lord saw it on 7\/24 (not sure what build he was running).\nI'd like to understand how this stuff works, why it behaved the way\nit did, etc., if it doesn't take too much of your time.\n\n------- Additional Comments From lord  07\/30\/98 16:53 ------- \n\nI just downloaded today's version of Nova, and it is not fixed.  It's trival to \nreproduce based on the script davidi provided.\n\nThere may have been other fixes recently, but this one is still broken.\n\n\n------- Additional Comments From jefft  07\/30\/98 18:15 ------- \n\nIf Forward Quoted or Forward Inline then reply the problem does *not* exist. If \nForward as Attachment then reply the problem does exist. Reply quote \nforward-as-attachment message in html picks up the S\/MIME icon. See the \nfollowing html content from the mail compose window. Looks like we need to find \na way to strip out the S\/MIME icon while quoting. (Similar thing to do when \nreply quote into plain text.) I should have tried Forward As Attachment then \nreply.

Shouldn't it be 4.04b instead?\nAnyway, this should be a bug against all 4.0.3 releases.\n\nThe browser can generate numerous repeated server requests for images that are\neither in the layer or are the layer background images on a forced RELOAD or a\nRESIZE when cache is set to 0\/0.  For example, with the current Netscape home\npage, there are a set of 10 images used by the menu on the top left corner.\nDepending on the version\/platform of the browser, the repeated download requests\nfor those 10 images can be anywhere from 50  to 1300 .  This problem is\nparticularly severe with the Sun Solaris browser:  It generated 1334 download\nrequests for those 10 images and 1139 of the 1334 reuests are for a particular\nimage mcombo.gif.\n\nAnother strange thing I observed is that the repeated request numbers are\ndifferent depending also on the server releases.  For example, with Sun Solaris\nbrowser, the request number 1334 is against the Enterprise 3.0 server.  I also\ntried it with a very old server on my Sun machine, I think it's the 1.2 release,\nand the request number is 613 for those 10 images.  Strange enough, this appears\nto be a much less severe problem with the IRIX browser; though repeated requests\nis also seen with the IRIX browser.\n\nIf you want to take a look of those repeated requests with your own eyes, you\ncan try the URL http:\/\/chaos\/www\/index4.html.  It is very close to what we have\non the Netscape home page.  The server access log is at\nchaos:\/home1\/siteadm\/suitespot\/https-chaos\/logs, and it is for an Enterprise 3.0\nserver on chaos.\n\nAccording to fur, this problem is caused by the browser IMAGE layer, since it\nhas no link with the NETWORK layer, and has no sense of whether an image file\nhas just been loaded within the context of a network connection and\/or a page.\n\nfur also suggested a possible workaround:\n\n<LAYER VISIBILITY=\"show\">\n<IMG NAME=work SRC=bogus WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200>\n<SCRIPT LANGUAGE=\"JavaScript1.2\">\ndocument.images.work.src=\"\/images\/jb.gif\";\n<\/SCRIPT>\n<\/LAYER>\n\nThat is, to set the image SRC to a bogus thing, and then use JavaScript\nto assign the SRC of the image.  I tried this, and it does not work as a\nwrokaround.  I found out that the SRC attribute has to be dropped in the <IMG>\ntag to make it somewhat work; otherwise, the browser would still send a bogus\nrequest to load a bogus file, and that would cause a server error and overhead\nto the server to handle the error, though it could save the actual download of\nthe image.  However, the browser would crash on a RESIZE.\nThis is perhaps yet another bug!?\n\nPlease mark this bug to be fixed in the next immediate release.\n\nThe Sun Solaris 4.0.x browser bug 81663 I filed in the past seemingly are\nreleated to this bug.","bug_severity":"major","dup_id":[],"short_desc":"WebSite-browser sends numerous repeated requests to download layer images when cache set to 0\/0","priority":"P1","version":"Trunk","component":"Networking: Cache","delta_ts":"2000-04-27 19:09:19 -0700","bug_status":"VERIFIED","creation_ts":"1997-09-17 07:00:00 -0700","resolution":"INVALID"}

The usual way in which to input the sharp-accented \"s\" is by\nthe use of \"Right-ALT s\" or \"Right-ALT S\" -- with the Polish keyboard file\ninstalled.\n\nThis works fine for NT, but for Windows 95, it hides or unhides the status\nbar at the bottom of a Communicator window instead.\n\nBy the way, Left-ALT s normally hides or unhides the Windows Task Bar if the\nmouse cursor is outside a Communicator window. (You need to have chosen the\n\"Do not automaticaly hide teh Task Bar option first).\n\nThis is a problem for those dependent on this key stroke to input their\naccented S.  Most probably affects some ISO-8859-2 languages.\n\nTo reproduce this:\n\n1. Use Window 95 (US or other versions)\n2. Install the Pollish keyboard option\n3. Open a new\/blank composer page\n4. Switch the encoding setting to ISO-8859-2\n5. Put the cursor in the composer window, and\n6. Press Right-ALT s or Right-ALT S and see the bottom status disappear and\n   appear again.\n   This also happens on our browser window, too.\n\nIn comparison, this does not happen with IE3 and some other Communicator\nwindows.\n\nThis does not happen on NT4.
